# Titanic Dataset Analysis

## Task 2: 
Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of your choice, such as the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. Explore the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.

## Overview
This repository contains an analysis of the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The dataset provides information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including features such as age, gender, class, and survival status. The goal of this analysis is to explore patterns, relationships, and trends within the data.

## Dataset Information
- **Source:** [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)
- **Files:**
  - `train.csv`: Training set with labels (survival status).
  - `test.csv`: Test set without labels.

## Files in this Repository
- `titanic_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis.
- `README.md`: Documentation for the analysis.
- `train.csv`: Train Dataset.
-  `test.csv`: Test Dataset.

## Analysis Highlights
1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
   - Handled missing values.
   - Engineered new features for better model performance.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Explored the distribution of key variables (age, gender, class).
   - Investigated survival rates across different categories.

3. **Statistical Insights:**
   - Calculated summary statistics for key variables.
   - Conducted hypothesis tests if applicable.

4. **Visualization:**
   - Created visualizations to convey key insights.
   - Used matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization.

## Running the Analysis
1. Install required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook titanic_analysis.ipynb`

## Contributions and Issues
Feel free to contribute to the analysis or report any issues. Pull requests are welcome!
